# ![icon](/images/iconx32.png 'icon') ink! Analyzer for Visual Studio Code

[ink!](https://use.ink/) language support for Visual Studio Code.

[ink!](https://use.ink/) is a programming language used for writing smart contracts for blockchains built with [Substrate](https://substrate.io/).

## Features

- diagnostics - errors and warnings based on ink! semantic rules.
- completions - completion suggestions for ink! attribute macros and arguments.
- code/intent actions - contextual assists for adding relevant ink! attribute macros and arguments to relevant items.
- hover content - descriptive/informational text for ink! attribute macros and arguments.

## Recommendations

[ink!](https://use.ink/) is built on top of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), so you'll have a much better experience with both [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer) and ink! analyzer enabled.

## Extension Settings

This extension provides the following settings:

- `ink-analyzer.server.path`: **(Optional)** Sets the path to ink! Language Server (ink-lsp-server) binary/executable (points to the bundled binary/executable that ships with the extension by default).
- `ink-analyzer.trace.server`: **(Optional)** Enables/disables tracing of the communication between VS Code and the ink! Language Server (not recommended for regular users).
